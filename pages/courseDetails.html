                <h3>What is Ui/Ux design</h3>
                <p>User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices,
                    focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. Ui design
                    refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms-e.g voice-controlled interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before it became known as user experience design (or more colloquially, UX), the field dedicated to improving usability was known as "human interface research." But the PC revolution of the 1980s, 
                    and the ensuing explosion of the internet in the next two decades, changed the ways in which the tech industry emphasized usability interaction design. It was Donald Norman, 
                    a 1993 Apple Fellow and UX pioneer, who pushed for the industry to adopt the term UX, as a way of signifying the more holistic nature of this changing approach.
                </p>
                <p>Today, the global design industry is valued at $165 billion, with impressive growth projected over the next decade. But in today's landscape, what does a UX designer actually do? 
                    Read on to find out how UX designers shape our experiences of the digital products we use every day.</p>

                <h3>What UI/UX designers do</h3>
                <p>
                    User experience designers build simple, intuitive interaction experiences that solve user problems in fun, aesthetically pleasing formats. To create a positive experience, designers must understand
                     user desires, attitudes, motivations, expectations, and pain points. UX designers investigate why users adopt products,
                     the key tasks they hope to accomplish with a product, and their attitudes towards the product itself. These insights inform product functionality and design.
